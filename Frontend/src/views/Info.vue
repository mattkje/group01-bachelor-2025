      <h1>About This Application</h1>
      <p>This application is developed as part of a bachelor thesis project. It utilizes Monte Carlo simulations to model and analyze complex systems and processes.</p>

      <h2>Monte Carlo Simulations</h2>
      <p>Monte Carlo simulations are a class of computational algorithms that rely on repeated random sampling to obtain numerical results. They are used to model the probability of different outcomes in a process that cannot easily be predicted due to the intervention of random variables.</p>
      <p>In this application, Monte Carlo simulations are used to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Analyze risk and uncertainty in prediction models.</li>
        <li>Optimize complex systems and processes.</li>
        <li>Perform sensitivity analysis to understand the impact of different variables.</li>
      </ul>
