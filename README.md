# Warehouse Simulation and Manning Problem for Delay Minimization

## Overview
This project aims to develop a tool for warehouse managers to optimize worker assignments across different warehouse zones in real-time. The software leverages Monte Carlo simulations to predict delays and allows managers to adjust worker allocations to minimize disruptions and enhance efficiency.

## Background
In warehouse operations, efficient human labor allocation is crucial for minimizing delays and maximizing productivity. Different tasks require varying amounts of time, influenced by the specific worker performing the task. Warehouses are typically divided into zones, and workers may move between these zones throughout the day.

A warehouse manager is responsible for assigning workers to different zones while operations are ongoing. This project seeks to provide a decision-support tool that enables managers to:
- Assign workers dynamically to zones based on real-time conditions.
- Utilize Monte Carlo simulations to predict potential delays.
- Adjust worker allocations and visualize their impact on key performance indicators.

## Features
- **Monte Carlo Simulations**: Predicts possible delays based on historical data and task variability.
- **Interactive Interface**: Displays real-time predictions and allows manual adjustments.
- **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)**: Tracks accumulated delays and other relevant metrics.
- **Scenario Testing**: Enables managers to explore different worker assignment strategies and their potential impact.

## Technologies
The specific technologies and frameworks used in this project will be determined during development, but may include:
- **Programming Languages**: Python, JavaScript, or other suitable languages
- **Simulation Frameworks**: NumPy, SciPy, or proprietary algorithms
- **Frontend**: Web-based dashboard (React, Vue.js, or similar)
- **Backend**: API and database for data storage and analytics

## Project Scope
- **Development Period**: January - May (Bachelor's Project at NTNU Ålesund)
- **Student Engagement**: 3-4 months of effective work
- **Expected Contributions from Industry Partner**: At least 25 hours of meetings and discussions

## Industry Partner
